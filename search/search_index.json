Part of a video series on calmcode.io . Base Example \u00b6 Clumper allows you to quickly parse through a list of data. Here's an example of a list of dictionaries. pokemon = [ { 'name' : 'Bulbasaur' , 'type' : [ 'Grass' , 'Poison' ], 'hp' : 45 , 'attack' : 49 } { 'name' : 'Charmander' , 'type' : [ 'Fire' ], 'hp' : 39 , 'attack' : 52 }, ... ] Download this dataset. You can fetch the dataset by from the commandline. wget https://calmcode.io/datasets/pokemon.json You can fetch the dataset by from python. import json import urllib.request url = 'http://calmcode.io/datasets/pokemon.json' with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as f: pokemon = json.loads(f.read()) You can also download it manually here . Given this list of dictionaries we can write the following query; from clumper import Clumper ( Clumper ( pokemon ) . keep ( lambda d : len ( d [ 'type' ]) == 1 ) . mutate ( type = lambda d : d [ 'type' ][ 0 ], ratio = lambda d : d [ 'attack' ] / d [ 'hp' ]) . select ( 'name' , 'type' , 'ratio' ) . sort ( lambda d : d [ 'ratio' ], reverse = True ) . head ( 5 ) . collect ()) What this code does line-by-line. This code will perform the following steps. It imports Clumper . It turns the list of pokemon dictionaries into a Clumper . It removes all the pokemon that have more than 1 type. The dictionaries that are left will have their type now as a string instead of a list of strings. The dictionaries that are left will also have a property called ratio which calculates the ratio between hp and attack . All the keys besides name , type and ratio are removed. The collection is sorted by ratio , from high to low. We grab the top 5 after sorting. The results are returned as a list of dictionaries. This is what we get back: [{ 'name' : 'Diglett' , 'type' : 'Ground' , 'ratio' : 5.5 }, { 'name' : 'DeoxysAttack Forme' , 'type' : 'Psychic' , 'ratio' : 3.6 }, { 'name' : 'Krabby' , 'type' : 'Water' , 'ratio' : 3.5 }, { 'name' : 'DeoxysNormal Forme' , 'type' : 'Psychic' , 'ratio' : 3.0 }, { 'name' : 'BanetteMega Banette' , 'type' : 'Ghost' , 'ratio' : 2.578125 }] Features \u00b6 This library has no dependencies besides a modern version of python. The library offers a pattern of verbs that are very expressive. You can write code from top to bottom, left to right.

The dictionaries that are left will have their type now as a string instead of a list of strings. These dictionaries will also get a property called ratio which is the ratio between hp and attack .
