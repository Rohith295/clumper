Part of a video series on calmcode.io . Base Example \u00b6 Clumper allows you to quickly parse through a list of data. Here's an example of a list of dictionaries. pokemon = [ { 'name': 'Bulbasaur', 'type': ['Grass', 'Poison'], 'hp': 45, 'attack': 49 }, { 'name': 'Charmander', 'type': ['Fire'], 'hp': 39, 'attack': 52 }, ... ] Download this dataset. You can fetch the dataset by from the commandline. wget https://calmcode.io/datasets/pokemon.json You can fetch the dataset by from python. import json import urllib.request url = 'http://calmcode.io/datasets/pokemon.json' with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as f: pokemon = json.loads(f.read()) You can also download it manually here . Given this list of dictionaries we can write the following query; from clumper import Clumper ( Clumper ( pokemon ) . keep ( lambda d : len ( d [ 'type' ]) == 1 ) . mutate ( type = lambda d : d [ 'type' ][ 0 ], ratio = lambda d : d [ 'attack' ] / d [ 'hp' ]) . select ( 'name' , 'type' , 'ratio' ) . sort ( lambda d : d [ 'ratio' ], reverse = True ) . head ( 5 ) . collect ()) What this code does line-by-line. This code will perform the following steps. It imports Clumper . It turns the list of pokemon dictionaries into a Clumper . It removes all the pokemon that have more than 1 type. The dictionaries that are left will have their type now as a string instead of a list of strings. The dictionaries that are left will also have a property called ratio which calculates the ratio between hp and attack . All the keys besides name , type and ratio are removed. The collection is sorted by ratio , from high to low. We grab the top 5 after sorting. The results are returned as a list of dictionaries. This is what we get back: [{ 'name' : 'Diglett' , 'type' : 'Ground' , 'ratio' : 5.5 }, { 'name' : 'DeoxysAttack Forme' , 'type' : 'Psychic' , 'ratio' : 3.6 }, { 'name' : 'Krabby' , 'type' : 'Water' , 'ratio' : 3.5 }, { 'name' : 'DeoxysNormal Forme' , 'type' : 'Psychic' , 'ratio' : 3.0 }, { 'name' : 'BanetteMega Banette' , 'type' : 'Ghost' , 'ratio' : 2.578125 }] Features \u00b6 This library has no dependencies besides a modern version of python. The library offers a pattern of verbs that are very expressive. You can write code from top to bottom, left to right. MIT License Installation \u00b6 You can install this package via pip . pip install clumper It may be safer however to install via; python -m pip install clumper For details on why, check out this resource .

This is big enough to not want to go through manually but also small enough that we don't need to worry too much about performance. Example \u00b6 Let's run a basic example. from clumper import Clumper ( Clumper ( pokemon ) . keep ( lambda d : len ( d [ 'type' ]) == 1 ) . mutate ( type = lambda d : d [ 'type' ][ 0 ], ratio = lambda d : d [ 'attack' ] / d [ 'hp' ]) . select ( 'name' , 'type' , 'ratio' ) . sort ( lambda d : d [ 'ratio' ], reverse = True ) . head ( 5 ) . collect ()) This is the result of this query.

It imports Clumper . It turns the list of pokemon dictionaries into a Clumper collection. It removes all the pokemon that have more than 1 type. The dictionaries that are left will have their type now as a string instead of a list of strings. These dictionaries will also get a property called ratio which is the ratio between hp and attack . All the keys besides name , type and ratio are removed. The collection is sorted by ratio , from high to low. We grab the top 5 after sorting. The results are returned as a list of dictionaries. Design \u00b6 The idea behind the library is that the API is like the English language. We could say that the dataset is like a noun and that each method is like a verb . Each verb will tell the API what will needs to happen to the data and the input to the verb will tell you how how this will happen. For example, the .keep() method will filter out data and how it will filter data is explained by the lambda function that we pass in. The idea is that most analyses that you'd be interested in doing can be constructed using just these verbs. You can see a detailed view of how to use all the verbs in the api description . We did not come up with this way of thinking about data analysis. In fact, this library is heavily inspired by the dplyr library in R .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"guides/getting-started.html#getting-started","text":"This library offers tools to deal with nested json data structure.

What are Verbs? \u00b6 In this library verbs are special kinds of methods. They really are just methods in essense but they imply a general pattern. In Clumper , a verb is a method that; Always returns a Clumper back, so it's chain-able. Has a name that tells you what is happening to the data while the parameters tell you how it is changing the data. This combination of properties allows you to write code in the same way you'd explain the steps to a human. Take this code for example. from clumper import Clumper list_of_dicts = [ { 'a' : 7 , 'b' : 2 }, { 'a' : 2 , 'b' : 4 }, { 'a' : 3 , 'b' : 6 } ] ( Clumper ( list_of_dicts ) . mutate ( c = lambda d : d [ 'a' ] + d [ 'b' ]) . sort ( lambda d : d [ 'c' ])) Schematically, this is what the code does. Mutate \u00b6 First we use the mutate verb. This allows us to add values to pairs in our collection. The output of this step is another Clumper collection. Sort \u00b6 Next we pick up the mutated collection and we apply a sort to it. Again, the output of this another Clumper . This means that we can keep adding steps as we further our analysis. Method Chaining \u00b6 This style of programming is really powerful and it keeps you productive once you've gotten a hang of the lambda functions. The lambda functions that you pass in can be general python. This also means that you're free to use nested dictionaries, sets or whatever you like doing in python. Common Verbs \u00b6 Here's a list of the verbs that you'll most likely use the most. Keep \u00b6 The keep verb allows you to grab a subset from the original collection. Mutate \u00b6 The mutate verb allows you to add/overwrite data to each item in the collection. Sort \u00b6 The sort verb allows you to sort the collection based on values of items. Select \u00b6 The select verb allows you to select a subset of keys for each item. Drop \u00b6 The select verb allows you to remove a subset of keys for each item. Group By \u00b6 The group_by verb allows you to set a group on a collection based on the values of the keys that you pass. The groups represent subsets and certain verbs will change their behavior if there are groups present. The main use-case for this verb is in combination with .agg() . Ungroup \u00b6 The ungroup verb will remove any groups currently present. Agg \u00b6 The agg verb is short for aggregate. They allow you to summarise the data, keeping in mind any groups that are on it. When defining a summary to apply you'll need to pass three things: the name of the new key the key you'd like to summarise (first item in the tuple) the summary you'd like to calculate on that key (second item in the tuple) The following aggregation functions are available: mean , count , unique , n_unique , sum , min and max .
