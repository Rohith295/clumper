poem = """
When you start a package,
you can wonder if you really should.
But it can be a great idea,
if code brings joy and the learning is good.

Understanding all the rules
can quickly become a chore.
But if you understand them well,
you'll know which ones to ignore.

Not every dataset is huge,
premature optimisation is getting cliche.
People might still like an api,
if it brings clarity right away.
