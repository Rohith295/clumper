#### Why the name?

Sometimes you just want something to "clump" together in the right way.
So we turned the word "clump" into a verb and into a python package.

#### How did it get started?

The origin of this package was educational. It got
started as free educational content on [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io).

#### When should I use it?

If you enjoy the functional style of programming and you have a small
enough dataset that you want to analyse quickly, this lightweight package might help.

#### When should I not?

The package works and has proper testing but it is not meant for very large
datasets.
